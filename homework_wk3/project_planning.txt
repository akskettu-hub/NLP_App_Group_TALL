# PROJECT PLANNING
The main idea of the application is to index court judgments. 
It makes court rulings more open and accessible to the public that is not necessarily familiar with the legislation and the legislative language.
We are planning on using the judgments, and perhaps some other documets, of the European Court of Human Rights.
